# CIFAR-10 Image Classification

## Project Goal:
The goal of this project is to classify images in the CIFAR-10 dataset using a deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The project includes advanced features such as data augmentation, batch normalization, dropout, and learning rate scheduling to enhance the model's accuracy and prevent overfitting.

## Important Files:
- **model.py**: The main Python script that contains the CNN model architecture and training logic.
- **requirements.txt**: The required Python libraries for running the project.
- **README.md**: Documentation for understanding and running the project.

## To Use This Project:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/edwardmagongo/model-cifar10-image-classification-edwardmagongo.git
